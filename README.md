Source file tokenizer for Go.

I might use this one day for searching really big code bases. Right now github.com/mjlyons/filesearch is really fast
Regexp'ing files in memory, so I'm not using this right now. But maybe one day I'll need to, or someone else
finds it helpful.

This code is pretty sloppy - it was the first thing I did in Go and I don't need to clean it up right now. Please
don't judge me on it =D.
